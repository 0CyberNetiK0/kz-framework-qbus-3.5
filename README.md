A NoPixel Like Server.

# Kazumi Framework
Hey all!

So this is a server I have been working with on and off for
the past year...

I was trying to recreate a good nopixel copy but with its own twists and features but now it lays gathering dust in
github not being used.

This server has been made from the ground up by myself and not based on any leaked servers out there! It's made using an older verion of QBCORE that as far as im aware doesnt exist anymore.

Take note this is NOT a plug and play server... This is a dev branch and has been since day one, Although it wouldnt take much to make playable it deffinitly could do with
some refinement.

Would just like to add as I can see this coming.. This IS
NOT XZ:RP! This isn't any server leak on known sites or others, This is my own server.

# VERY IMPORTANT
This servers core is encrypted and available on the tebex store for a mere $5, The reason for this is to deter re-sellers from taking this server and trying to sell it for daft amounts. But in this repo you do get the whole server just not the core files to be able to launch the server... So if you want to launch the server join the discord below and check the available links and announcements.
